# ` data/jdbc_drivers` folder 

This empty folder will be used for storing the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
driver files required for the OHDSI/DatabaseConnector package. The drivers
will be downloaded automatically based on the used database management system
as defined in the configuration file (`config.yaml`) with the
`amstel::download_drivers()` function.
